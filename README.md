# FlowerShop JavaFX Application ðŸŒ»ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ¼

Welcome to my **FlowerShop JavaFX Application** repository! This project is a part of my journey to learn and enhance my skills in Java programming and JavaFX for creating GUI applications. Through this project, I explored various concepts such as data binding, event handling, file I/O, and form validations, while also focusing on designing user-friendly interfaces.

## Overview
This project is a fully interactive **FlowerShop application** built using JavaFX. The application allows users to:
1. Enter their details (Name, Email, Phone).
2. Browse a variety of flowers available for purchase.
3. Select quantities of flowers and generate a receipt.
4. Manage stock quantities of flowers dynamically based on purchases.

The purpose of this project was to simulate a small-scale e-commerce platform for learning JavaFX concepts and file-based data management.

## Features
- **Opening Screen**: User enters their name, email, and phone number with proper input validations.
- **Flower Selection**: Displays a table of flowers with prices, available quantities, and an interactive quantity selector.
- **Checkout Screen**: Shows a receipt of the purchase with the total cost.
- **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Stock is updated based on the user's purchase.
- **File I/O**: Uses `Flowers.txt` to store flower data and `CustomerDetails.txt` to record customer transactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The programming language used for the backend logic.
- **JavaFX**: For building the GUI interface.
- **File I/O**: To manage flower inventory (`Flowers.txt`) and customer transaction records (`CustomerDetails.txt`).

## How It Works
1. **User Details**:
   - The application starts with an opening screen where users must enter their **name**, **email**, and **phone number**.
   - Validations ensure:
     - Name contains only alphabets.
     - Email is in the correct format.
     - Phone number is numeric and at least 10 digits long.

2. **Flower Selection**:
   - A table displays all available flowers, including their names, prices, and available quantities.
   - Users can select the desired quantity of each flower.

3. **Checkout**:
   - The checkout screen provides a detailed receipt, including customer details, selected flowers, total cost, and updated inventory.
   - Customer and transaction data are saved in `CustomerDetails.txt`.

4. **Dynamic Inventory Management**:
   - Once a purchase is confirmed, the flower stock is reduced dynamically in the `Flowers.txt` file.
